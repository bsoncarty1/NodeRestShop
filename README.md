# NodeRestShop

A RESTful API. This REST API utilizes MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose. Users can create, read, update, and delete Products and Orders on the Cloud Database.

To run the server, start a new terminal at the node-rest-shop folder, and run the command "npm start". Then, use Postman to send requests.

Example raw JSON body POST request for http://localhost:3000/products
{
  "name": "Harry Potter",
  "price": "12.99"
}
